    - description: |
        Introduced use of DKIM for calendaring and scheduling services.

        The XML elements "supported-calendar-data" and "calendar-data" were renamed to "supported-calendar-data-type" and "calendar-data-type" respectively to avoid confusion with the "calendar-data" XML element being used in the "response" XML element.

        The "recipient" XML element was redefined to accept (#PCDATA) instead of an "href" XML element.

        The grammar of new HTTP headers is now using the ABNF syntax defined in <<RFC5234>>.

        Fixed various typos.
